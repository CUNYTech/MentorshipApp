#Obec takes its name from the Slovak translation from the English word "community". Obec creates a community among people where they can find short-term or long-term mentors in different areas such as Women in Tech, Career Advice, Life Advice, Programming, and so on.
#Meerkats live and work together in their communities. They look out for one another. Obec brings together people from different backgrounds to look out for one another. If you know something valuable and would like to share, then please contribute as a mentor. If you are looking to have someone's #point of view on something you don't know or simply don't understand and hold interest on, then please sign up as a mentee. Here at Obec, we give you the opportunity to be both. Let's seek help and provide help.
