            <p>
                Obec takes its name from the Slovak translation from the English word "community". The goal of this web application
                is to create a community among people where they can find short-term or long-term mentors in different areas such as
                Women in Tech, Career Advice, Life Advice, Programming, and so on.

                Our logo design of a meerkat symbolizes community. Meerkats live and work together in their communities. They look out
                for one another. Obec brings together people from different backgrounds to look out for one another. If you know something 
                valuable and would like to share, then please contribute as a mentor. If you are looking to have someone's point of view
                on something you don't know or simply don't understand and hold interest on, then please sign up as a mentee. Here at Obec, we give you the
                the opportunity to be both. Let's seek help and provide help.
